***

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

### Added

### Removed

### Fixed

***

## [1.6.6]

### Fixed

- Fix attempt to set timeouts and run other functions on nullptr

***

## [1.6.5]

### Fixed

- Fix attempt to print to nullptr

***

## [1.6.4]

### Fixed

- Fixed compiler warning

***

## [1.6.3]

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Changed arguments of byteToFrame function
- Ensure all buffers are filled with 0's before filling them with real values

***

## [1.6.2]

### Changed

- null terminate all character strings (c-style character arrays)
  - This applies to all characters added to an input buffer from the `charFrom{Input/Holding}Register(...)` and `charFromFrame(...)` functions.

***

## [1.6.1]

### Added

- Added debugging of slicing/subsetting arrays

### Fixed

- Reordered retry logic

***

## [1.6.0]

### Changed

- Reorganized functions in h file
- Renamed some internal variables in the cpp file.

### Added

- Added overload functions `{type}FromHoldingRegister(..)`. These are identical to the `{type}FromRegister(..)` functions.
- Added support for broadcasts to address 0.

***

## [1.5.0]

### Changed

- Change the timeout for the underlying stream object immediately after frame timeout is changed.

### Added

- Added functions to set and get pointers to the stream used for communication
- Added functions to set and get the slave ID.
- Added additional constructors

***

## [1.4.0]

### Changed

- Removed all variable length arrays within functions
- No longer trimming returned Strings

### Added

- Implemented a single static command buffer
- Added the define `COMMAND_BUFFER_SIZE` to control the size of the command buffer.
- Added `charToRegister(..)` and `charToFrame(..)` functions, each accepting a pointer to a constant char (const char*).

### Fixed

- Fixed return value for sendCommand function.

***

## [1.3.0]

### Changed

- The sendCommand function will now return a value of > 4095 (0x0FFF) if there has been an error. The upper most byte of the uint16_t response to the command is the modbus error code. This makes it much easier to differentiate error responses and no responses.

### Added

- Added extra functions specifying "holding" or "input" in the function name.
- Added the ability to change the number of times to retry commands.
- Added the ability to change the command and frame timeouts.
- Added an enum for modbus error codes.
- Added a variable to store the last error code, which can be checked with `getLastError()` and printed with `printLastError()`.

### Fixed

- Fixed calculate of expected return size

***

## [1.2.0]

### Changed

- When dumping the buffer, wait the frame timeout time between characters instead of a set 1ms.

***

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Added setters and getters for the enable pin, modbus command timeout, and modbus frame timeout.

***

## [1.0.1]

### Fixed

- Corrected comments on input and holding registers.  Input registers are the ones that are read only; holding registers are read/write.

***

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- Added functions to read coils
- Added functions to write single and multiple coils
- Added functions to read discrete inputs
- Added functions to read holding and input registers without requiring the command type as input
- Added functions to read coils, discrete inputs, holding, and input registers into a user buffer
- Added code spell configuration

### Fixed

- Fixed spelling errors

***

## [0.7.3]

### Changed

- Re-release of 0.7.2 with updates to VERSION and library properties/json

***

## [0.7.2]

### Changed

- Update `readWriteRegister.ino` example to work with AltSoftSerial

### Added

- Add a new `getSetAddress.ino` example #30

### Fixed

- Fix `printFrameHex()` that was broken with v0.7.0 #29

***

## [0.7.1]

### Changed

- Update examples to apply to more processors
- Implement testing of more processors
- Set the platforms/architectures supported list to "*" (all)

***

## [0.7.0]

### Changed

- Applied clang format to source and examples.
- Moved the scanRegisters example from the utils to the examples folder.
- Updated Arduino library keywords file.
- Changed the debugging functionality to not require a define.

### Added

- Added Doxygen documentation comments.
- Created a documentation page using Doxygen.
- Added CI checks with Github actions using reusable workflows.

### Removed

- Removed build files and documentation for custom RS-485 boards.
This information can now be found in its [own repository](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Mayfly-Modbus-Wing).

***

## [0.6.8]

### Added

- Added documentation for the wing shield.

***

## [0.6.7]
